The user enters a name of an artist or band and a mix tape or play-list is generated. A list of 10 randomly selected songs within the artist’s genre with the album cover, song name, album, and artist name. The user can name the playlist and it’s saved to a list of playlists. A media player allows the user to play songs within the playlist.
